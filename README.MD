# Find It!

A very fast hash-based dynamic dictionary matching. **Under construction...**

## Target

Search for all occurances of gram patterns in a given text, supporting online insertion & deletion. I/O are processed in batches, allowing a certain scale of parallelism. See http://sigmod17contest.athenarc.gr/ for more details.

The original competition task is modified slightly by
- Assume all inputs are ASCII
- A line with a single 'E' refers to the end of a batch
- Return a multiset of occurances
